To achieve this, having the Facebook SDK installed and properly configured is essential.
Hereâ€™s a guide on setting up the SDK in your React Native for both Andriod And IOS:

![meta and react native](https://i.imgur.com/hfOHSvg.png)

# Step 1: Install the Facebook SDK for React Native

### 1. Install the react-native-fbsdk-next package:

```js
npm install react-native-fbsdk-next

```

> This package is a community-maintained alternative to the original react-native-fbsdk and is recommended for compatibility with newer versions of React Native.
> I want the readers to read it carefully as it contains many important docs.

### 2. Link the SDK (for older versions of React Native):

```js
npx react-native link react-native-fbsdk-next

```

If youâ€™re using React Native 0.60 or higher, this step is generally not needed as auto-linking should work.

And for IOS you have to install the SDK using cocopods

```js
cd ios/ && pod install

```

# Step 2: Set Up the Facebook App and Get App ID and Client token

1. Go to the [Facebook for Developers site](https://developers.facebook.com/).
2. Create a new app if you donâ€™t have one already.
3. Copy the App ID from your Facebook app settings. Youâ€™ll need this for configuration.
4. Copy the client token as well. Youâ€™ll find the it under App ID and App Secret.

# Step 3: Configuration

Let's start by going through the steps for Android setup first.

## Andriod

1. Open the <mark>android/app/build.gradle</mark> file and add this line in the dependencies section.

```java
dependencies {
    your code here
    .................

    // Meta SDK
    implementation 'com.facebook.android:facebook-android-sdk:latest.release'
}

```

2. Now open the <mark>android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml</mark> file and add these 2 lines inside resources section. Ensure you replace the App ID and Client Token with the ones you copied from your Facebook dashboard (refer to Step 2).

```java
resources {
    your code here
    .................

    <string name="facebook_app_id">0000000</string>
    <string name="facebook_client_token">000000</string>
}

```

3. Next open the <mark>Android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml</mark> file and add meta-data to the application element

```java
<application android:label="@string/app_name" ...>
    ...
    <meta-data android:name="com.facebook.sdk.ApplicationId" android:value="@string/facebook_app_id"/>
    <meta-data android:name="com.facebook.sdk.ClientToken" android:value="@string/facebook_client_token"/>
</application>

```

ðŸŽ‰ that's it ðŸŽ‰ save all files and build your project. Let's move on to IOS.

## IOS

1. Configure the <mark>Info.plist</mark> file with an XML snippet that contains data about your app. Add these lines to the file and make sur to replace <mark>fbAPP-ID</mark> and <mark>CLIENT-TOKEN</mark> by yours yoy have copied from your facebook APP (see step 2).

```js #

    <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
    <array>
    <dict>
    <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
    <array>
        <string>fbAPP-ID</string>
    </array>
    </dict>
    </array>
    <key>FacebookAppID</key>
    <string>APP-ID</string>
    <key>FacebookClientToken</key>
    <string>CLIENT-TOKEN</string>
    <key>FacebookDisplayName</key>
    <string>APP-NAME</string>
```

2. Connect the App Delegate: open AppDelegate.m file and paste this code there.

```swift

#import <AuthenticationServices/AuthenticationServices.h>
#import <SafariServices/SafariServices.h>
#import <FBSDKCoreKit/FBSDKCoreKit-Swift.h>

```

> One thing to keep an eye on here is the location where you past the import if you are using an old version of react-native <mark class="gr">0.67.5</mark> and below. Make sur to past the import outside of <mark class="gr">#ifdef FB_SONARKIT_ENABLED</mark>

```swift

// Meta SDK
#import <FBSDKCoreKit/FBSDKCoreKit-Swift.h>
#import <AuthenticationServices/AuthenticationServices.h>
#import <SafariServices/SafariServices.h>

#ifdef FB_SONARKIT_ENABLED
#import <FlipperKit/FlipperClient.h>
#import <FlipperKitLayoutPlugin/FlipperKitLayoutPlugin.h>
.....
#endif

```

3. Inside <mark>didFinishLaunchingWithOptions</mark>, add the following:

```swift

  [[FBSDKApplicationDelegate sharedInstance] application:application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions];

```

now in the same file go down and add this:

```swift

  - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)app
            openURL:(NSURL *)url
            options:(NSDictionary<UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey,id> *)options
{
  return [[FBSDKApplicationDelegate sharedInstance]application:app
                                                      openURL:url
                                                      options:options];
}

```

If you're using React Native's RCTLinkingManager or deep linking go donw to <mark>(BOOL)application:(UIApplication \*)application</mark> replace it with this:

```swift
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)app
            openURL:(NSURL *)url
            options:(NSDictionary<UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey,id> *)options
{
  if ([[FBSDKApplicationDelegate sharedInstance] application:app openURL:url options:options]) {
    return YES;
  }

  if ([RCTLinkingManager application:app openURL:url options:options]) {
    return YES;
  }

  return NO;
}

```

Now go to <mark>app.tsx</mark> or any other entry point in your project and initiate the SDK by adding these lines:

```js
import { Settings } from "react-native-fbsdk-next"

Settings.initializeSDK()
```

4. Now in the last as I wanted our app for Advertising and for iOS 14 devices facebook asked to enable the Apple Advertising tracking (AAT).
   First install react-native-tracking-transparency to get user consent

```js
npm install react-native-tracking-transparency

cd ios
pod install

```

thene add NSUserTrackingUsageDescription to your <mark>Info.plist</mark>

```swift
  <key>NSUserTrackingUsageDescription</key>

  <string>We use Tracking to fix bugs and improve your experience.</string>
```

Last add this to your <mark>App.tsx</mark> file

```js
import { Settings } from "react-native-fbsdk-next"

import { requestTrackingPermission } from "react-native-tracking-transparency"


useEffect(() => {
const trackingStatus = await requestTrackingPermission()

if (trackingStatus === "authorized" || trackingStatus === "unavailable") {
  await Settings.setAdvertiserTrackingEnabled(true)
}

}, []);
```

> Requires iOS 14. On Android and iOS versions below 14, this will always return 'unavailable'.

# Let's have a look at the result

You'll start seeing events in the Events Manager of your Facebook app like the image below:
